Introduction
Our task was to implement our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge which we had learned at Masai. We used this skillset to build a static copy of croma.com along with the responsiveness of the page for different screen sizes.
How we started the project
<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/1*XI3CIMKg7XZUdz_SwTqO7g.png"/>

We started this project with just a few simple questions like what we can do in this project and in this short span of time how much we can deliver, what major points we should consider, and how to implement communication while working remotely. We were able to identify all the problems one shall face while building the project and had necessary guidelines in place which would help us move forward step by step rather than jumping and opening many things at a time.
The platform used for communication
For delivering a result-oriented output of any work/project communication between the team is the most crucial part. We used slack , zoom, google meet and whatsapp to communicate with each other. The effective and goal-oriented approach towards communication made this task a lot easier for us.
Challenges
Git-pull and push of the code.
Merging each other code for the first time.
Adding javascript for functionalities.
Takeaways
To be able to work on a project the team members must possess leadership qualities, he should be able to contribute ideas and be respectful to others.
Overall, it was a surreal experience, and we look forward to many such challenges.Thank you Chandra Sir fo such a great project..
